      "Bring filtered water to a boil.",

      "Add ground coffee to filter.",

      "First pour: At 45 seconds, add 140 grams of water, pouring in gentle concentric circles, moving from the center to the outside of the bed, ensuring not to touch sides of filter. Total brew weight should now be 200 grams.",
      "Second pour: At around 1:20, add 100 grams of water, keeping the same pouring technique. Make sure not to fill higher than the level of grounds you have already established.",
      "Final pour: At 1:50-1:55 minutes, add 80 grams of water. Then, using a spoon, scrape along the edge of the filter at the top of the brew, ensuring not to touch the brew bed.",
      "Coffee should finish brewing between 2:45 and 3:00.",
      "Stir and enjoy!"

    "directions":[
      "Fold the filter into a cone shape and rinse it in the Hario dripper with water just off the boil (about 205°F) to eliminate paper flavor and to heat up the mug or carafe you are brewing into. Discard the rinse water.",
      "Grind 21 grams (about 3 Tablespoons) of coffee to be about as fine as kosher salt. Add coffee to your brewer.",
      "Saturate the grounds with water right off the boil (about 205°F). Use just enough water to cover the grounds. Let it bloom for 15 seconds. Coffee de-gasses or “blooms” when it’s fresh–the coffee bed should raise up and bubble a bit.",
      "Pour water in a slow, even spiral, adding water every 10 – 15 seconds for an even extraction. Pour over the dark spots and avoid the light ones. If you're using a scale, you should pour until you reach 360 g.",
      "Once you hit 3:00, you should have about 10 oz of brewed coffee. Remove the brewer and pour the coffee into a warm mug."
